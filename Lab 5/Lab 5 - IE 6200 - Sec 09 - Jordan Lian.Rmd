# Problem Statement
My understanding of the assignments comes from the most recent chapters, where we combined the basic probability concepts to understand different types of continuous and discrete distributions. I used the packet to solve the tasks for the lab, which is what I usually do for most lab assignments.

# Output
\textcolor{blue}{Question 1:} On average, 4 traffic accidents per month occur at a certain intersection. What is the probability that in any given month at this intersection

X: RV, traffic accidents per month, $\mu = 4$ accidents

(a) exactly 4 accidents will occur?
```{r 1a}
# p(X = 4 accidents)
dpois(4, 4)
```

(b) fewer than 3 accidents will occur?
```{r 1b}
# p(X < 3 accidents) = p(X <= 2 accidents)
ppois(2, 4)
```

(c) at least 2 accidents will occur?
```{r 1c}
# p(X >= 2 accidents) = 1 - p(X < 2 accidents)
1 - ppois(1, 4)
```

\textcolor{blue}{Question 2:} The probabilities are 0.4, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.1, respectively, that a delegate to a certain convention arrived by air, bus, automobile, or train.

#### p(air) = 0.4, p(bus) = 0.2, p(automobile) = 0.3, p(train) = 0.1
(a) What is the probability that among 9 delegates randomly selected at this convention, 3 arrived by air, 3 arrived by bus, 1 arrived by automobile, and 2 arrived by train?
```{r 2a}
# 3 by air, 3 by bus, 1 by automobile, 2 by train
dmultinom(x=c(3, 3, 1, 2), size=9, prob=c(0.4, 0.2, 0.3, 0.1))

\textcolor{blue}{Question 3:} A research scientist reports that mice will live an average of 40 months when their diets are sharply restricted and then enriched with vitamins and proteins.

X: RV, lifetime of mice, $\mu = 40$ months, $\sigma = 6.3$ months

(a) more than 32 months
```{r 3a}

(b) less than 28 months
```{r 3b}
# p(X < 28 months)
pnorm(28, mean=40, sd=6.3)
```

(c) between 37 and 49 months
```{r 3c}
# p(37 < X < 49 months)
pnorm(49, mean=40, sd=6.3) - pnorm(37, mean=40, sd=6.3)

\textcolor{blue}{Question 4:} A large company has an inspection system for the batches of small compressors purchased from vendors. A batch typically contains 15 compressors. In the inspection system, a random sample of 5 is selected and all are tested. Suppose there are 2 faulty compressors in the batch of 15.

X: RV, number of faulty compressors, N = 15 compressors, k = 5 chosen, m = 2 faulty compressors, n = 13 non-faulty compressors

(a) What is the probability that for a given sample there will be 1 faulty compressor?
```{r 4a}

\textcolor{blue}{Question 5:} If the probability that a fluorescent light has a useful life of at least 800 hours is 0.9, find the probabilities that among 20 such lights

X: RV, number of fluorescent lights with a useful life of at least 800 hours, p(useful life >= 800 hours = 0.9), sample of 20

X: RV, # tries it takes or student to pass a written pilot license test

(a) on the third try
```{r 8a}

\textcolor{blue}{Question 9:} Rate data often follow a lognormal distribution. Average power usage (dB per hour) for a company is studied and is known to have a lognormal distribution with parameters $\mu = 4$ and $\sigma = 2.$

(a) What is the probability that the company uses more than 270 dB during a particular hour?
```{r 9a}
# p(X > 270 dB during 1 hour)
1 - plnorm(q=270, meanlog=4, sdlog=2)
```

# Conclusion
There were no statistical inferences and observations from the results obtained. They were probability questions that I solved using R. I double checked my answers to make sure my code was accurate, which was helpful on a few occasions, especially on problem 8, when I realized I had to subtract the argument by 1 for the dgeom() function to get the correct answer.
